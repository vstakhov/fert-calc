# fert-calc

`fert-calc` is a small and specific utility that I have written to simplify DIY mixing of the aquarium fertilisers based on different components, dosing schemas and so on.
The main goal of this utility is to provide a command line interface to simplify manual calculations for dilutions and dosing.

## Status

This project is created for personal hobby and is not intended to be useful for anyone. It is also in alpha stage, so many functions are yet missing.

## Roadmap

Large/important features:

* [x] Agricultural fertilizers and percent based fertilizers
* [ ] Dosing regimes: EI/Dose to reach the target etc
* [x] Custom fertilisers and compounds trivial names (urea, CSM+B etc)

Small features:

* [ ] Hydrates support
* [ ] Saving for the input values to avoid extra hassle
* [x] Solution based dilution
* [ ] Solubility warnings
* [ ] Target solution PH
